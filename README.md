Installation

1. Install _node.js_: https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Make sure you have the latest versions of node and npm (which is downloaded with node) by running `node -v` (should be v8.9.1 or higher) and `npm -v` (should be 5.6.0). If you do not, you can use nvm to update node and `npm install npm@latest -g` to update npm.
