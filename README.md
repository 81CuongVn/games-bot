# games-bot

A discord bot to enjoy all your favourite board games with your friends. Tic Tac Toe, Spyfall, Coup, and more. This app was created using [Express 4](http://expressjs.com/), based off of the [Getting Started with Node on Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs) article - check it out..


## Installation

1. Install [_node.js_](https://nodejs.org/en/) and the [Heroku CLI](https://cli.heroku.com/) installed.
2. Make sure you have the latest versions of node and npm (which is downloaded with node) by running `node -v` (should be v8.9.1 or higher) and `npm -v` (should be 5.6.0). If you do not, you can use nvm to update node and `npm install npm@latest -g` to update npm.
3. GamesBot requires a few node modules. Install all of the required modules by running `npm install`
4. The program should now be ready to run. Type `npm start` to launch the program.
5. Your app should now be running on [localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/).
